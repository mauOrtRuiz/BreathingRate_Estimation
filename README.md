First we extract the data fields from the .json

Next we implement a basic processing, based on the next reference: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8402314/pdf/sensors-21-05651.pdf

here are the steps:


1.-As a basic preprocessing the RR signal is resampled to 6 Hz

2.- We apply a BP filter. For this task a 4th order Butterworth filter with frequencies from 0.2 Hz to 1.2 Hz was designed and applied to the resampled data.
Here we can see both signals bafore and after filtering:

3.-  BR estimation is done by Short-Term Fourier Transform (STFT). For this step windows of size 10, and 20 were explored first, however, it is a short time and not enough to have 1 decimal resolution and also 30 and 40 sec are tested.

4.- The Spectrogram is prepared to visualize the signal behaviour

BR must be between the range [0.2 Hz - 1.2 Hz]   Strong frequencies corresponding to BR can be observed between second 1600 and 1700. The corresponding time-series between 1600-1700 gives an approximation to the BR

We can observe the PSD of this interval

5.- Output generation: The output is generated by a two column vector with first column for timestamp and second coluimn for the estimated BR. The results are saved into a .csv file
